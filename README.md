# Valentine's Day Letter App

An interactive web app created to help express love, gratitude, and appreciation. This project was built as a gentle reminder to say the things we often forget to say to the people we care about, whether they are close friends, distant friends, or those who have meant a lot to us in the past.

In the future, it aims to grow into a customizable platform where anyone can write, personalize, and share meaningful letters with the people they care about.


## Design & Experience

All visual assets were custom-designed for this project, including the background, envelope, sticker, and letter. The goal was to create an experience that feels personal rather than generic or templated.

To protect the privacy of each letter, content is only shown when a valid recipient name and last initial are entered. This ensures that messages remain personal and accessible only to their intended recipients.
